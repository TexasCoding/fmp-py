##  Overview

The `fmp-py` project is a comprehensive Python library designed to interface with the [Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/), enabling seamless retrieval and analysis of a wide array of financial data. Core functionalities include accessing historical and intraday stock prices, company information, IPO calendars, mergers and acquisitions, stock splits, earnings reports, dividends, forex, and cryptocurrency data. It provides well-structured data models and methods to fetch, process, and integrate various financial metrics, enhancing users ability to perform detailed financial market analyses and make informed investment decisions efficiently.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project follows a modular architecture with separate files for different financial data functionalities, aiding in maintainability and scalability. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The code adheres to consistent coding standards and practices with a focus on maintainability and readability, supported by pre-commit hooks and ruff for linting. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The project includes comprehensive documentation generated by Sphinx, with themes like `sphinx-rtd-theme`. Documentation covers usage and API reference. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | Integrates with Financial Modeling Prep API for financial data. Utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration to automate testing workflows. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | Highly modular with well-defined interfaces. Modules can be easily reused and extended, facilitating integration in various financial applications. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | Uses `requests-mock` for mocking API requests in tests. GitHub Actions are used for automating the test execution. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | Efficiently handles API requests with caching via `requests-cache` and rate-limiting through `requests-ratelimiter` to optimize performance. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | Employs `python-dotenv` for secure management of environment variables, ensuring API keys and sensitive information are protected. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include `requests`, `pandas`, `pendulum`, `sphinx`, `requests-cache`, and `requests-ratelimiter` among others, as specified in `pyproject.toml`. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | Designed to scale with increased API request loads, thanks to efficient use of caching, rate limiting, and modular architecture. |
